    <h2 id="headline">Here's a time line of Yasser Arafat</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1929</strong> He was born in Cairo to a Palestinian family.</li>

      <li><strong>1937</strong>When his father married a second wife, his father and 
        sister Inaam took him to live alongside and under their care
         in Cairo. His relationship with his father was getting worse every day</li>

      <li><strong>1950</strong> from civil engineering.</li> 

      <li> After Arafat returned to the university, he studied civil engineering. He also continued his political 
        activities, so he was elected president of the Palestinian Students' Union in Cairo from<strong>1952</strong>to<strong>1956</strong></li> 
      
        <li><strong>1957</strong> applied for a visa from Kuwait, obtained a visa, traveled to Kuwait and worked as an architect. In Kuwait, he met two of his friends, who are two Palestinian members of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, namely Salah Khalaf, whose nom de guerre is Abu Iyad, and
         the second is Khalil al-Wazir, whose nom de guerre is Abu Jihad. The two later became Arafat's right arm.</li> 
        
         <li><strong>1969</strong> presided over the Executive Council of the Palestine Liberation 
           Organization, at the meeting of the Palestinian National Council held in Cairo, succeeding Yahya Hammouda, the former president of the organization. Thus, he became the supreme leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, which included several Palestinian organizations, 
           and continued to hold this position until his death.</li> 
           
          
           <li><strong>1973</strong> he became the head of the political arm of the Palestine Liberation Organization</li>

           <li><strong>1974</strong> and his advisors adopted a ten-point program prepared by the Palestinian 
             National Council. He suggested reaching a settlement with the Israelis. According 
             to that settlement, the Palestine Liberation Organization would acquire the Gaza Strip and the West Bank
              from Israel after it occupied them in 1948 to establish the Palestinian state on them. This agreement was 
              welcomed by some members of the Palestine Liberation Organization, as it was a reason for the separation of some 
              other organizations such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
               Palestine from the Palestine Liberation Organization.
              The rejectionist front was established from those organizations.</li>

              <li>After leaving Lebanon, Yasser Arafat focused his efforts on the political 
                work in which he excels, and the culmination of this political work was the declaration 
                of Palestinian independence in <strong>1988</strong> by the Palestinian National Council and Yasser Arafat's speech on December 13 before the General Assembly in Geneva, which moved its headquarters to Geneva in a manner. Temporary 
                due to the refusal of the US government to grant him an entry visa to the United States.</li>

                <li><strong>2004</strong> at the age of 75</li>
